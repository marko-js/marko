# Marko + Lasso

The [lasso-marko](https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso-marko) plugin for [Lasso.js](https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso) will automatically compile all imported Marko templates during bundling. In addition, the `lasso-marko` plugin will automatically bundle any template dependencies (including required CSS).

Lasso.js provides Marko custom tags for injecting JavaScript and CSS bundles, images and other resources.

The sample [lasso-express](https://github.com/marko-js/examples/tree/master/examples/lasso-express) app demonstrates how to build a production-ready web application using Marko and Lasso. Run `npx @marko/create --template lasso-express` to use this sample as a starting point for a new app.

## Installation

```
npm install lasso-marko --save
```

## Registering the plugin

```js
require('lasso').configure({
    "plugins": [
        ...
        "lasso-marko"
    ]
    ...
});
```

## Lasso custom tags

To inject the required JavaScript and CSS into the page you will want to use the `<lasso-page>`, `<lasso-head>` and `<lasso-body>` tags.

If you are using lasso@^3 (latest), make sure to install the [lasso-marko-taglib](https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso-marko-taglib), so that you can use the lasso custom tags.

```
npm install lasso-marko
npm install @lasso/marko-taglib
```

After installing, the lasso custom tags can be used in your templates:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Marko + Lasso</title>
    <lasso-head />
  </head>
  <body>
    <lasso-body />
  </body>
</html>
```

Lasso.js will automatically bundle up transitive dependencies by building and walking a dependency graph.

## Client-side rendering

Marko templates can be imported and rendered by any JavaScript module. The code below shows how to render a top-level UI component and have it be mounted to the DOM as a child `document.body`:

_client.js_

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
require("./components/app/index.marko")
  .renderSync({})
  .appendTo(document.body);
```

When Lasso.js bundles up the code above it will automatically bundle up the required `./components/app/index.marko` file.

## Server-side rendering

If you are rendering the initial UI on the server then it is necessary to make sure that all UI components are bundled and sent to the browser so that UI components can be mounted in the browser. For example:

_about-me/index.marko_

```marko
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Marko + Lasso</title>

        <!-- CSS will be inserted here -->
        <lasso-head/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Top-level UI component: -->
        <app/>

        <!-- JS will be inserted here -->
        <lasso-body/>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Browser refresh

[browser-refresh](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/browser-refresh) is recommended in development for instant page refreshes and hot reloading of Marko templates, styles and other resources. `browser-refresh` works well with Lasso and Marko and is very easy to use as a drop-in replacement for `node`:

```bash
browser-refresh server.js
```

## Lasso package types commonly used with Marko

For many use cases, the combination of `lasso-marko` and `@lasso/marko-taglib` is sufficient to render and bundle components without the need for explicit `browser.json` files. For more advanced use cases, the following bundle types may be defined in a `browser.json` for Lasso.

#### `marko-dependencies` _(provided by `lasso-marko`)_

Includes all the dependencies needed by template and the code to register all components that would be rendered by the template. It does not automatically initialize the component, so is most useful if you need to initialize components manually.

```json
{
  "type": "marko-dependencies",
  "path": "src/ui-modules/outdated-browser-banner/index.marko"
}
```

**Note:** To initialize the server rendered components, there are 2 steps:

**Step 1:** Manually _retrieve_ server rendered components, shipped via `marko-dependencies`.

To retrieve the list of server rendered components, do:

```javascript
template.render(data, (err, output) => {
  const renderedComponentsList = require("marko/components").getRenderedComponents(
    output.out
  );
  const html = output.getOutput();
});
res.json({
  renderedComponentsList,
  html
});
```

**Step 2:** Manually _initialize_ server rendered components, shipped via `marko-dependencies`.

To initialize the list of server rendered components, do:

```javascript
// from the response received, retrieve as
require("marko/components").init(response.renderedComponentsList);
```

**Note:** Ensure Step 2 is inside a DOM-ready wrapper, for the legacy widgets layer to load (if there are widgets built out of Marko 3, that is being used inside a Marko 4 component.)

#### `marko-hydrate` _(provided by `lasso-marko`)_

Includes all the dependencies needed by template and the code to register all components that would be rendered by the template. This also includes the code to initialize the rendered components. Including this bundle on the page will automatically hydrate server rendered components.

```json
{
  "type": "marko-hydrate",
  "path": "src/ui-modules/outdated-browser-banner/index.marko"
}
```

**Note:** `marko-hydrate` will initialize the component if its defined on the global `window.$components` which is inserted by `Marko` when it sees a `<body>` tag. Else, if you are just rendering out and lasso-ing the a portion of a page with a set of components, include `<init-components/>` at the end of the associated `template.marko` file that builds out the page fragment.

#### `package`

A collection of dependencies. `browser.json` is the most common package type.
It could be used to point to another `browser.json` from within one component's `browser.json`.
Typically also used when the dependencies of the referred `browser.json` have to be packaged inline.

```json
{
  "type": "package",
  "path": "src/ui-modules/show-diag/browser.json"
}
```

#### `require`

If a javascript file has to be wrapped over for its common JS syntax, to a browser understandable format.

```json
{
  "type": "require",
  "path": "src/ui-modules/dynamic-module-loader/dynamic-init-client.js"
}
```

#### `require` and `run`

If a javascript file has to be wrapped over for its common JS syntax, to a browser understandable format and be executed immediately.

```json
{
  "run": true,
  "type": "require",
  "path": "src/ui-modules/my-module/init.js"
}
```
