# Marko Helpers

This directory contains helpers that were deprecated in Marko v3. Marko v4 no longer adds these helpers to every compiled template, but you can still import them if needed:

```xml
<script marko-init>
var empty = require('marko/helpers/empty');
var notEmpty = require('marko/helpers/notEmpty');
</script>
```
