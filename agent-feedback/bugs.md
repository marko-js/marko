## `Sorted.isSuperset` arithmetic is wrong but the current behavior is load-bearing

`packages/runtime-tags/src/translator/util/optional.ts` › `Sorted.isSuperset` | 2026-07-03 | impact:med | effort:med

`isSuperset` walks `subset` from the top and rejects with
`supLen - found <= i`, which compares the remaining superset slots against `i`
(the count of _smaller_ elements) instead of `subLen - i` (the count still to
place). It returns `false` for many genuine superset relationships, including
two identical sorted arrays: `isSuperset([1,2,3],[1,2,3])` is `false`. The one caller,
`isSupersetSources` (`references.ts:2395`), gates intersection serialization at
`references.ts:1131`/`1145`. Naively correcting the arithmetic to
`supLen - found < subLen - i` makes `isSupersetSources` return `true` for
equal-source bindings, so both symmetric `addSerializeReason` calls are skipped
and neither binding in the intersection serializes — this under-serializes and
breaks resume (the `bound-attr-shapes` fixture throws `Unable to serialize
"ControlledHandler:#input/2"`). The current over-serializing behavior is
therefore relied upon for correctness. A real fix needs `isSupersetSources` to
use a strict/proper-superset test (equal sources must not prune each other)
_and_ the corrected arithmetic, then a full snapshot audit — out of scope for a
one-line change.

## Inline reorder runtime holds only one pending `onNextSibling` callback

`packages/runtime-tags/src/html/inlined-runtimes.debug.ts` › `REORDER_RUNTIME_CODE` | 2026-07-10 | impact:low | effort:med

`runtime.x` keeps a single `nextSibling`/`onNextSibling` pair. A `<t hidden>`
swap callback pending at the element's next sibling is overwritten if, while
walking the `<t>`'s children, a placeholder-end comment (`!id`) matches the
"content arrived before its end marker" branch and re-assigns the pair — the
outer swap then never fires. Tracing current server emission orders suggests
this is unreachable today (catch/content `<t>`s and their end markers always
stream in an order where the earlier callback fires before the overwrite),
but it is one flush-ordering change away from a silent hydration freeze. A
queue (or firing the pending callback before re-assigning) would make the
inline runtime robust; weigh against inline-runtime byte cost.

## Inert Class parent drops client resume for a stateful Tags-API descendant

`packages/runtime-tags/src/translator/visitors/tag/dynamic-tag.ts` › `translate.exit` | 2026-07-13 | impact:high | effort:high

A Tags-API page that renders an inert Class-API component (no class block /
component-browser) which itself renders a stateful Tags-API grandchild produces
a dead (non-resuming) grandchild after SSR: clicking a `<button onClick>` in the
grandchild does nothing, in **both** debug and optimize. In optimize the class
boundary is additionally removed outright by the inert-child optimization here
(`!classHydration && !tagsSerializeReason` → `tag.remove()`), because
`getClassHydrationMode` (`packages/runtime-class/src/translator/index.js:714`)
only detects interactivity via `meta.component` and never inspects a Tags-API
child's `isInteractive` (which lives on `program.node.extra`, not
`metadata.marko`). But disabling that removal does **not** fix the dead button,
so the root cause is a deeper resume gap for stateful-tags-inside-inert-class,
not just the optimization. Repro (CSR works, SSR-resume dead): tags page
`// use tags` + `<class-wrapper/>`; `class-wrapper.marko` =
`<div><tags-counter/></div>` (no class block); `tags-counter.marko` =
`<let/n=0/><button onClick(){n++}>${n}</button>`. A fix likely needs the tags
translator to surface interactivity on `metadata.marko`, `getClassHydrationMode`
to return DESCENDANT for interactive tags children, and the boundary to actually
resume.

## `_dynamic_tag` compares only the renderer id, conflating instances of the same content

`packages/runtime-tags/src/dom/control-flow.ts` › `_dynamic_tag` | 2026-07-14 | impact:high | effort:med

The dynamic-tag change checks compare `renderer?.[RendererProp.Id] || renderer` (`:535` for `_dynamic_tag`, `:647` for `_dynamic_tag_content`, plus the DOM `_attr_content`). `RendererProp.Id` is the template/section resume id, identical for every _instance_ of one content section — instances differ only by their `RendererProp.Owner` scope. So switching a dynamic tag between two instances of the same content — two `<attrs.content>` from two instances of one provider tag, or the list-detail `<${selected.content}/>` — is a silent no-op: no teardown or re-render, and closures stay subscribed to the old owner's scope. A control with two _distinct_ tag files behaves correctly, pinning the defect to the id-only comparison. Fix: compare `(id, owner)` — content renderer objects are recreated per render so identity alone over-fires, while the owner scope is stable per instance; the resume handshake must serialize a scope-registered renderer as its registered reference so the first post-resume update stays instance-aware.

## Initialize tag variables for dynamic native tags

`packages/runtime-tags/src/html/dynamic-tag.ts` › `_dynamic_tag` | 2026-07-15 | impact:med | effort:high

The string-renderer branch of HTML `_dynamic_tag` never assigns `result` (the inline TODO calls this out), and the DOM branch creates the element but never sends its getter through the branch's `AccessorProp.TagVariable` callback (`dom/control-flow.ts:547`). Verified by adding `<${input.show && "div"}/el/><script>el().textContent = "set"</script>` to the `dynamic-tag-var` fixture: both CSR and SSR-resume left the `<div>` empty because `el` was never initialized, so its dependent effect never ran. Static native tags instead create a registered `_el(...)` getter; the dynamic-native path needs the equivalent getter tied to the created/resumed branch element in both runtimes.

CSR is a runtime-only fix: push `() => childScope[AccessorProp.StartNode]` through the child scope's `TagVariable` callback right after the native branch is created in `dom/control-flow.ts`. SSR-resume is the hard part and needs the translator, not just the runtime. The native branch scope carries no state, so `_var`'s `writeScopePassive` `#TagVariable` slot is never serialized (the server fill contains only the parent scope); a dynamic _component_ tag var only resumes because its scope serializes anyway, carrying `{ "#TagVariable": _(1, "…/var") }`. So on resume there is no callback to invoke from the `BranchEndNativeTag` marker handler (`dom/resume.ts:232`). Runtime-only escapes don't exist: `_dynamic_tag` is never told a tag var is present (the compiler emits a separate `_var`), and forcing every tag var to serialize its scope actively regresses payload size for all of them. Delivering the getter across the dynamic boundary requires the compiler to serialize/reconstruct an element reference (a client-side `_el(id, accessor)` for the resumed branch element) — hence effort:high spanning compiler + runtime + serialization.

A live `@marko/run` app shows this manifests as a HARD SSR 500 in dev, not just an empty render: reading the ref (`<${shape}/mark .../>` then `<effect>{ mark().getBBox() }` or a `<script>` reader) makes the HTML `_dynamic_tag` return `undefined` for `mark`, which the compiler guards with `_assert_hoist(mark)` — throwing MARKO_DEBUG's misleading `Hoisted values must be functions, received type "undefined"` (`packages/runtime-tags/src/common/errors.ts:109-114`), with a stack pointing at compiled runtime rather than the user's tag-variable construct. Under optimize `_assert_hoist` is compiled out, so SSR instead succeeds but serializes `mark: undefined`, and on the client `_hoist("mark")()` throws "undefined is not a function" when the effect/script runs — a silent dev-vs-prod divergence. Beyond the full high-effort compiler+serialization fix already noted, a low-effort, independently-valuable improvement is a compile-time error/warning when a tag variable is placed on a dynamic tag that can resolve to a native tag name, so users get a source-level diagnostic instead of an internal assert (dev) or broken hydration (prod).
